title: "Why vaccine equity needs better data, not just better messaging"
---
Vaccine equity is often discussed as a communication challenge. It is also a data architecture challenge.

When burden estimates are delayed, surveillance systems are fragmented, and outcome definitions vary across sites, policy choices become reactive. This widens inequities between settings with strong information systems and those without them.

A stronger pathway is to invest in interoperable surveillance, pragmatic trial designs, and regional analytic capacity. Better local evidence changes procurement decisions, target group prioritization, and rollout strategy.

Equity improves when evidence is generated where decisions are made.
