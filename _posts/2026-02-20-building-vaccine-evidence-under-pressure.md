title: "Building vaccine evidence under emergency pressure"
---
When outbreaks accelerate, the scientific instinct is to protect rigor while the operational instinct is to move faster. Effective emergency research does both.

The practical challenge is not only protocol design. It is alignment across ethics committees, local investigators, ministries of health, laboratories, and communities. If those systems are not prepared in advance, evidence generation slows exactly when decisions must be made quickly.

Three principles guide my approach:

1. Design studies for implementation, not only publication.
2. Build country-level capacity before the emergency cycle.
3. Translate interim evidence into policy-ready options.

In global health, speed without quality creates risk. Quality without speed reduces relevance. The goal is to deliver evidence that is both trustworthy and timely.
